:description: Use Hazelcast in an Istio environment.

{description}

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a Hazelcast cluster and connect it with Hazelcast client. Then, you will also see how to deploy an application with embedded Hazelcast.

== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster
+
This tutorial uses Google Kubernetes Engine but you can use any Kubernetes cluster.
+
```bash
gcloud container clusters create hazelcast-cluster --num-nodes=4
```

== Install Istio 1.7.3

This code sample has been tested against Istio 1.7.3

. Download Istio and configure the path for `istioctl`.
+
```bash
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
export PATH=`pwd`/`ls | grep istio`/bin:$PATH
```

. Install Istio CRDs.
+
```bash
istioctl install --set profile=demo --skip-confirmation
```

. Make sure that both the `istioctl` client and the control plane have the same version.
+
```bash
istioctl version
```

```
client version: 1.7.3
control plane version: 1.7.3
data plane version: 1.7.3 (2 proxies)
```
== Hazelcast 5.0 Updates
With hazelcast 5.0 hazelcast-kubernetes is part of hazelcast and you do not need an additional dependency. For more details on how to run hazelcast in k8s
you can refer to https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/deploy/deploying-in-kubernetes.html[deploying hazelcast on kubernetes]

== How does peers discover each other
There are two ways that peers can discover each other in a kubernetes cluster.

=== Kubernetes API
For this the hazelcast member will interact with k8s rest api to fetch IPs of pods. This requires setting up role binding(RBAC). Also your HazelcastConfig will look like:
```java
Config config = new Config();
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getKubernetesConfig().setEnabled(true);
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getKubernetesConfig().setProperty("service-name","hazelcast-embedded-headless");
```

=== DNS Lookup
For this the hazelcast members ask dns of a headless service to fetch IPs of all pods. This does not require any special RoleBinding and is ideal if
your members are within the same kubernetes cluster. The HazelcastConfig will look like this:
```java
Config config = new Config();
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getKubernetesConfig().setEnabled(true);
config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getKubernetesConfig().setProperty("service-dns","hazelcast-embedded-headless.namespace");
```
Here <namespace> is where your hazelcast headless service is deployed.

== Run the Code Sample

Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/istio.git
cd istio
```
. To setup discovery using kubernetes API apply RBAC.
+
```bash
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
```
. To setup discovery using DNS lookup, in Application.java set property "service-dns" with hazelcast-embedded-headless.<namespace>


Istio Sidecar AutoInjection is done automatically if you label the default namespace with `istio-injection`. If you want to implement manual injection with the deployments then you need to use `istioctl kube-inject`.

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

The business logic in both examples are the same to keep it simple. `put` operation puts a key-value pair to Hazelcast and `get` operation returns the value together with the Kubernetes Pod name. `PodName` is used to show that the value is returned from any Pod inside the Kubernetes cluster to prove the true nature of distributed cache.

=== Hazelcast Client Server

Let's first switch to the client-server directory.

```bash
cd hazelcast-client-server
```

Client-Server code sample can be built and pushed to your own Docker Hub or some other registry via following command but that is optional.

```bash
mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:1.8.0:build -Dimage=YOUR-NAME/istio-client:1.0
```

Instead, you can use the already pre-built docker image `hazelcastguides/istio-client:1.0`.

NOTE: If you want to build your own image, then do not forget to update `hazelcast-client.yaml` with your own image.

Deploy Hazelcast Cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-cluster.yaml
```

You can see that 3 member cluster has been initiated with 3 pods. `2/2` in `READY` column means that there are 2 containers running in each Pod. One is Hazelcast member and the other is Envoy Proxy.

----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-cluster-0   2/2     Running   0          60s
hazelcast-cluster-1   2/2     Running   0          44s
hazelcast-cluster-2   2/2     Running   0          27s
----

Deploy the Spring Boot application with the Hazelcast client:

----
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-client.yaml
----

Check the logs and see that the Spring Boot service is connected to the cluster:

----
$ kubectl logs hazelcast-client-0 hazelcast-client
...
Members [3] {
	Member [10.16.2.14]:5701 - 51274b4d-dc7f-4647-9ceb-c32bfc922c95
	Member [10.16.1.15]:5701 - 465cfefa-9b26-472d-a204-addf3b82d40a
	Member [10.16.2.15]:5701 - 67fdf27a-e7b7-4ed7-adf1-c00f785d2325
}
...
----

Run a container with cURL installed and set an environment variable to point to the Spring load balancer.

First, find the IP of Spring Boot Service:

----
$ kubectl get svc springboot-service
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
springboot-service   ClusterIP   10.19.250.127   <none>        80/TCP    3m29s
----

Launch a `curl` container inside Kubernetes cluster and set the service IP as an environment variable:
----
kubectl run curl --rm --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE=10.19.250.127
----

Put a value to the cluster:
----
$ curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/put?key=1&value=2"
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-client-2"}
----

Get the value from cluster in a loop and see that it is retrieved from different Pod names:
----
$ while true; do curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/get?key=1"; sleep 2;echo; done
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-client-1"}
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-client-0"}
...
----

In this sample, you were able to deploy a Spring Boot based microservice with Hazelcast client-server topology in Istio Environment.

Clean up the deployments with the following commands:
----
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-client.yaml
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-cluster.yaml
----

=== Hazelcast Embedded

Switch to the embedded code sample directory:
----
cd hazelcast-embedded
----

Embedded code sample can be built and pushed to your own Docker Hub or some other registry via following command but that is optional:
----
mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:1.8.0:build -Dimage=YOUR-NAME/istio-embedded:1.0
----

Instead, you can use the already pre-built docker image `hazelcastguides/istio-embedded:1.0`.


NOTE: If you want to build your own image, then do not forget to update `hazelcast-embedded.yaml` with your own image.

Deploy Hazelcast Embedded Sample:
----
$ kubectl apply -f hazelcast-embedded.yaml
statefulset.apps/hazelcast-embedded created
service/hazelcast-embedded-headless created
service/springboot-service created
----

You can check that the application started and Hazelcast successfully formed a cluster.

----
$ kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-embedded-0 hazelcast-embedded
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.12.1.6]:5701 - 644e6bbf-335a-410b-80ab-0cb648dbc772
        Member [10.12.2.8]:5701 - 0ab13148-b6bb-477e-970b-0b5c226ed2aa this
        Member [10.12.3.4]:5701 - 72f56c90-f55e-490c-b3c0-d40fe970557f
]
...
----


When you list the services used, you will see that you have two Kubernetes Services: `hazelcast-embedded-headless` and `springboot-service`. `hazelcast-embedded-headless` is used to handle Hazelcast cluster discovery operation so it has no need to have an IP address. `springboot-service` is the loadbalancer that is used to receive http requests and forward them to one of the underlying pods to respond.
----
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
hazelcast-embedded-headless   ClusterIP   None           <none>        5701/TCP   9s
kubernetes                    ClusterIP   10.19.240.1    <none>        443/TCP    73m
springboot-service            ClusterIP   10.19.252.76   <none>        80/TCP     9s
----

Let's now put a key-value pair into Hazelcast cluster through Spring Boot REST Service and then call get operation in a loop to see the value is returned from different Pods.

Firstly, let's run a container with `curl` installed and set an environment variable to point to Spring Load Balancer:
----
kubectl run curl --rm --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE=10.19.252.76
----

Put a value to the cluster:
----
$ curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/put?key=1&value=2"
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-2"}
----

Get the value from cluster in a loop and see that it is retrieved from different Pod names:
----
$ while true; do curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/get?key=1"; sleep 2;echo; done
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-1"}
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-0"}
...
----

In this sample, you were able to deploy a Spring Boot based microservice with Hazelcast Embedded in Istio Environment. Let's clean up the deployments with the following command.

----
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-embedded.yaml
----

== Summary

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Hazelcast Embedded and client/server topology in an mTLS-enabled Istio environment with Automatic Sidecar Injection. Hazelcast continuously tries to support cloud native technologies and verifies those environments as they evolve.
